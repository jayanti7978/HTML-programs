    <p>A mature, non-traditional, or adult student in tertiary education (at a university or a college) is normally classified as an
         (undergraduate) student who is at least 21â€“23 years old at the start of their course and usually having been out of the education system
          for at least two years. Mature students can also include students who have been out of the education system for decades, or studentswithnosecondary education. Mature students also make up graduate and postgraduate populations by demographic of age University students  associated with pranks and japes since the creation of universities in the Middle Ages.[16][17][18][19][20] These can
            crime, such as the theft of traffic cones and other public property,[21] or hoaxes. It is also not uncommon for students fromschool
             to steal or deface the mascot of a rival school.[22] In fact, pranks play such a significant part in student culture that numeroubooks
             have been published that focus on the issue. Students who are repeating a grade level of schooling due to poor grades are sometimes referred to as having been "held back" or "kept back". In Malaysia and Singapore they are described as "retained". In the Philippines they are called "repeater". The term 'pupil' (originally a Latin term for a minor as the ward of an adult guardian, etc.) is used in some Commonwealth primary and secondary schools (particularly in England and Wales) instead of "student", but once attending further education (at a sixth-form college) or higher education (at university for example), the term "student" is standard. The term pupil is also used in the Philippines by the Department of Education to refer to learners currently in elementary school; the term student is used for by the Department of Education for learners in high school. </p><br>

             <p>There has also been a recent trend to rename or create government secondary schools as "colleges".
                 In the state of Victoria, some state high schools are referred to as secondary colleges,
                 In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, "college" is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In New South Wales, some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as "secondary colleges". In Queensland some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are styled state college, but state schools offering only secondary education are called "State High School". In Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, "college" refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, "college" is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of matriculation college. In a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called "collegiates" or "collegiate institutes" (C.I.), a complicated form of the word "college" which avoids the usual "post-secondary" connotation. This is because these secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools (such as Upper Canada College, Vancouver College) choose to use the word "college" in their names nevertheless.[9] Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the separate school system, may also use the word "college" or "collegiate" in their names.[10] In New Zealand the word "college" normally refers to a secondary school for ages 13 to 17 and "college" appears as part of the name especially of private or integrated schools.</p><br>
